- **Real-time AI Conversations**: Interactive chat interface with GPT-4 powered HR executive
- **Performance Feedback**: Get scored feedback (1-10) on your interview performance after completion

## Demo

The interview process includes:
1. Setup phase where you provide your personal information
2. Interactive interview with 5 question-answer exchanges
3. Detailed feedback with an overall score and improvement suggestions

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-interview-feedback-tool.git
cd ai-interview-feedback-tool
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit openai streamlit-js-eval
```

3. Create a `.streamlit` directory in the project root:
```bash
mkdir .streamlit
```

4. Create a `secrets.toml` file inside `.streamlit` directory:
```bash
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

5. Add your OpenAI API key to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

**Important**: Never commit your `secrets.toml` file to GitHub. It's included in `.gitignore`.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run interview_feedback.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`)

3. Fill in your personal information:
   - Name
   - Experience
   - Skills
   - Desired level (Junior/Mid-level/Senior)
   - Position
   - Target company

4. Click "Start Interview" and begin your mock interview

5. Answer 5 interview questions in the chat interface

6. Click "Get Feedback" to receive your performance evaluation

7. Use "Restart Interview" to try again with different settings

## Configuration

### Customizing the Interview

You can modify the interview experience by editing `interview_feedback.py`:

- **Number of Questions**: Change `st.session_state.user_message_count < 5` to adjust the number of interview rounds
- **Model Selection**: Update `"gpt-4o"` to use different OpenAI models
- **Character Limits**: Adjust `max_chars` values for input fields
- **Available Positions**: Add or remove positions in the selectbox options
- **Companies**: Customize the list of companies

## Technologies Used

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: Web framework for creating the interactive UI
- **[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/)**: GPT-4 for generating interview questions and feedback
- **[streamlit-js-eval](https://github.com/aghasemi/streamlit_js_eval)**: JavaScript evaluation for page reload functionality

## How It Works

1. **Setup Phase**: Collects user information and interview preferences
2. **Interview Phase**: 
   - Initializes GPT-4 with a system prompt containing user details
   - Conducts a conversational interview with streaming responses
   - Tracks message count to limit interview length
3. **Feedback Phase**:
   - Sends the complete conversation history to GPT-4
   - Generates structured feedback with a numerical score
   - Provides actionable suggestions for improvement

## Limitations

- Interview is limited to 5 user responses
- Requires an active OpenAI API key with sufficient credits
- Input text is limited to prevent excessive token usage
- Feedback is generated by AI and should be used as a learning tool, not as professional career advice

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add voice input/output capabilities
- [ ] Include video interview simulation
- [ ] Provide industry-specific interview questions
- [ ] Save interview history and track progress over time
- [ ] Add more detailed analytics on response quality
- [ ] Support for multiple languages
- [ ] Export feedback as PDF report
